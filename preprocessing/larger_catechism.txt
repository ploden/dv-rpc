Christ maketh intercession, by his appearing in our nature continually before the Father in heaven, in the merit of his obedience and sacrifice on earth, declaring his will to have it applied to all believers; answering all accusations against them, and procuring for them quiet of conscience, notwithstanding daily failings, access with boldness to the throne of grace, and acceptance of their persons and services.Heb. 9:12, 24; Heb. 1:3; John 3:16; John 17:9, 20, 24; Rom. 8:33-34; Rom. 5:1-2; 1 John 2:1-2; Heb. 4:16; Eph. 1:6; 1 Pet. 2:5.Q. 56. How is Christ to be exalted in his coming again to judge the world?A. Christ is to be exalted in his coming again to judge the world, in that he, who was unjustly judged and condemned by wicked men, shall come again at the last day in great power, and in the full manifestation of his own glory and of his Father’s, with all his holy angels, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, to judge the world in righteousness.Acts 3:14-15; Matt. 24:30; Luke 9:26; Matt. 25:31; 1 Thess. 4:16; Acts 17:31.Q. 57. What benefits hath Christ procured by his mediation?A. Christ by his mediation hath procured redemption, with all other benefits of the covenant of grace.Heb. 9:12; 2 Cor. 1:20.Q. 58 How do we come to be made partakers of the benefits which Christ hath procured?A. We are made partakers of the benefits which Christ hath procured by the application of them unto us, which is the work especially of God the Holy Ghost.John 1:11-12; Titus 3:5-6.Q. 59. Who are made partakers of redemption through Christ?A. Redemption is certainly applied, and effectually communicated, to all those for whom Christ hath purchased it; who are in time by the Holy Ghost enabled to believe in Christ according to the gospel.Eph. 1:13-14; John 6:37, 39; John 10:15-16; Eph. 2:8; 2 Cor. 4:13.Q. 60. Can they who have never heard of the gospel, and so know not Jesus Christ, nor believe in him, be saved by their living according to the light of nature?A. They who, having never heard the gospel, know not Jesus Christ, and believe not in him, cannot be saved, be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature, or the laws of that religion which they profess; neither is there salvation in any other, but in Christ alone, who is the Saviour only of his body the Church.Rom.  10:14; 2 Thess.  1:8-9; Eph.  2:12; John  1:10-12; John  8:24; Mark  16:16; 1 Cor. 1:20-24; John 4:22; Rom. 9:31-32; Phil. 3:4-9; Acts 4:12; Eph. 5:23.Q. 61. Are all they saved who hear the gospel, and live in the Church?A. All that hear the gospel, and live in the visible Church, are not saved; but only they who are true members of the Church invisible.John 12:38-40; Rom. 9:6; Matt. 22:14; Matt. 7:21; Rom. 11:7.Q. 62. What is the visible Church?A. The visible Church is a society made up of all such as in all ages and places of the world do profess the true religion, and of their children.1 Cor. 1:2; 1 Cor. 12:13; Rom. 15:9-12; Rev. 7:9; Ps. 2:8; Ps. 22:27-31; Ps. 45:17; Matt. 28:19-20; Isa. 59:21; 1 Cor. 7:14; Acts 2:39; Rom. 11:16; Gen. 17:7.Q. 63. What are the special privileges of the visible Church?A. The visible Church hath the privilege of being under God’s special care and government; of being protected and preserved in all ages, notwithstanding the opposition of all enemies; and of enjoying the communion of saints, the ordinary means of salvation, and offers of grace by Christ to all the members of it in the ministry of the gospel, testifying, that whosoever believes in him shall be saved, and excluding none that will come unto him.Isa. 4:5-6; 1 Tim. 4:10; Ps. 115:1-18; Isa. 31:4-5; Zech. 12:2-4,8-9; Acts 2:39, 42; Ps. 147:19-20; Rom. 9:4; Eph. 4:11-12; Mark 16:15-16; John 6:37.Q. 64. What is the invisible Church?A. The invisible Church is the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ the head.Eph. 1:10, 22-23; John 10:16; John 11:52.Q. 65. What special benefits do the members of the invisible Church enjoy by Christ?A. The members of the invisible Church, by Christ, enjoy union and communion with him in grace and glory.John 17:21; Eph. 2:5-6; John 17:24.Q. 66. What is that union which the elect have with Christ?A. The union which the elect have with Christ is the work of God’s grace, whereby they are spiritually and mystically, yet really and inseparably, joined to Christ as their head and husband; which is done in their effectual calling.Eph. 1:22; Eph. 2:6-8; 1 Cor. 6:17; John 10:28; Eph. 5:23, 30; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Cor. 1:9.Q. 67. What is effectual calling?A. Effectual calling is the work of God’s almighty power and grace, whereby (out of his free and special love to his elect, and from nothing in them moving him thereunto) he doth, in his accepted time, invite and draw them to Jesus Christ, by his Word and Spirit; savingly enlightening their minds, renewing and powerfully determining their wills, so as they (although in themselves dead in sin) are hereby made willing and able freely to answer his call, and to accept and embrace the grace offered and conveyed therein.John 5:25; Eph. 1:18-20; 2 Tim. 1:8-9; Titus 3:4-5; Eph. 2:4-5, 7-9; Rom. 9:11; 2 Cor. 5:20, 2 Cor. 6:1-2; John 6:44; 2 Thess. 2:13-14; Acts 26:18; 1 Cor. 2:10, 12; Ezek. 11:19; Ezek. 36:26-27; John 6:45; Eph. 2:5; Phil. 2:13; Deut. 30:6.Q. 68. Are the elect only effectually called?A. All the elect, and they only, are effectually called; although others may be, and often are, outwardly called by the ministry of the Word, and have some common operations of the Spirit; who, for their willful neglect and contempt of the grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ.Acts 13:48; Matt. 22:14; Matt. 7:22; Matt. 13:20-21; Heb. 6:4-6; John 12:38-40; Acts 28:25-27; John 6:64-65; Ps. 81:11-12.Q. 69. What is the communion in grace, which the members of the invisible Church have with Christ?A. The communion in grace, which the members of the invisible Church have with Christ, is their partaking of the virtue of his mediation, in their justification, adoption, sanctification, and whatever else in this life manifests their union with him.Rom. 8:30; Eph. 1:5; 1 Cor. 1:30.Q. 70. What is justification?A. Justification is an act of God’s free grace unto sinners, in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them, and received by faith alone.Rom. 3:22, 24-25; Rom. 4:5; 2 Cor. 5:19, 21; Rom. 3:22, 24-25, 27-28; Titus 3:5, 7; Eph. 1:7; Rom. 5:17-19; Rom. 4:6-8; Acts 10:43; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9.Q. 71. How is justification an act of God’s free grace?A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real and full satisfaction to God’s justice in the behalf of them that are justified; yet in as much as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son, imputing his righteousness to them, and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith, which also is his gift, their justification is to them of free grace.Rom. 5:8-10, 19; 1 Tim. 2:5-6; Heb. 10:10; Matt. 20:28; Dan. 9:24, 26; Isa. 53:4-6; Isa. 53:10-12; Heb. 7:22; Rom. 8:32; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 3:24-25; Eph. 2:8; Eph. 1:7.Q. 72. What is justifying faith?A. Justifying faith is a saving grace, wrought in the heart of a sinner, by the Spirit and Word of God, whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition, not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel, but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness therein held forth, for pardon of sin, and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.Heb. 10:39; 2 Cor. 4:13; Eph. 1:17-19; Rom. 10:14, 17; Acts 2:37; Acts 16:30; John 16:8-9; Rom. 5:6; Eph. 2:1; Acts 4:12; Eph. 1:13; John 1:12; Acts 16:31; Acts 10:43; Phil. 3:9; Acts 15:11.Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it, nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification; but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.Gal. 3:11; Rom. 3:28; Rom. 4:5; Rom. 10:10; John 1:12; Phil. 3:9; Gal. 2:16.Q. 74. What is adoption?A. Adoption is an act of the free grace of God, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, whereby all those that are justified are received into the number of his children, have his name put upon them, the Spirit of his Son given to them, are under his fatherly care and dispensations, admitted to all the liberties and privileges of the sons of God, made heirs of all the promises, and fellow-heirs with Christ in glory.1 John 3:1; Eph. 1:5; Gal. 4:4-5; John 1:12; 2 Cor. 6:18; Rev. 3:12; Gal. 4:6; Ps. 103:13; Prov. 14:26; Matt. 6:32; Heb. 6:12; Rom. 8:17.Q. 75. What is sanctification?A. Sanctification is a work of God’s grace, whereby they whom God hath before the foundation of the world chosen to be holy, are in time through the powerful operation of his Spirit, applying the death and resurrection of Christ unto them, renewed in their whole man after the image of God; having the seeds of repentance unto life, and all other saving graces, put into their hearts, and those graces so stirred up, increased, and strengthened, as that they more and more die unto sin and rise unto newness of life.Eph. 1:4; 1 Cor. 6:11; 2 Thess. 2:13; Rom. 6:4-6; Eph. 4:23-24; Acts 11:18; 1 John 3:9; Jude 1:20; Heb. 6:11-12; Eph. 3:16-19; Col. 1:10-11; Rom. 6:4, 6, 14; Gal. 5:24.Q. 76. What is repentance unto life?A. Repentance unto life is a saving grace, wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit and word of God, whereby, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, and upon the apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, he so grieves for and hates his sins, as that he turns from them all to God, purposing and endeavouring constantly to walk with him in all the ways of new obedience.2 Tim. 2:25; Zech. 12:10; Acts 11:18, 20-21; Ezek. 18:28, 30, 32; Luke 15:17-18; Hos. 2:6-7; Ezek. 36:31; Isa. 30:22; Joel 2:12-13; Jer. 31:18-19; 2 Cor. 7:11; Acts 26:18; Ezek. 14:6; 1 Kings 8:47-48; Ps. 119:6, 59, 128; Luke 1:6; 2 Kings 23:25.Q. 77. Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?A. Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification, yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the righteousness of Christ; in sanctification his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof; in the former, sin is pardoned; in the other, it is subdued; the one doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation; the other is neither equal in all, nor in this life perfect in any, but growing up to perfection.1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 4:6, 8; Ezek. 36:27; Rom. 3:24-25; Rom. 6:6, 14; Rom. 8:33-34; 1 John 2:12-14; Heb. 5:12-14; 1 John 1:8, 10; 2 Cor. 7:1; Phil. 3:12-14.Q. 78. Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?A. The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins, are hindered in all their spiritual services, and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.Rom. 7:18, 23; Mark 14:66-72; Gal. 2:11-12; Heb. 12:1; Isa. 64:6; Ex. 28:38.Q. 79. May not true believers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken with, fall away from the state of grace?A. True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God, and his decree and covenant to give them perseverance, their inseparable union with Christ, his continual intercession for them, and the Spirit and seed of God abiding in them, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.Jer. 31:3; 2 Tim. 2:19; Heb. 13:20-21; 2 Sam. 23:5; 1 Cor. 1:8-9; Heb. 7:25; Luke 22:32; 1 John 3:9; 1 John 2:27; Jer. 32:40; John 10:28; 1 Peter 1:5.Q. 80. Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?A. Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavor to walk in all good conscience before him, may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God’s promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made, and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God, be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace and shall persevere therein unto salvation.1 John 2:3; 1 Cor. 2:12; 1 John 3:14, 18-19, 21, 24; 1 John 4:13, 16; Heb. 6:11- 12; Rom. 8:16; 1 John 5:13.Q. 81. Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate  of  grace,  and  that  they  shall  be  saved?A. Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith, true believers may wait long before they obtain it; and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions; yet are they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God, as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.Eph. 1:13; Isa. 1:10; Ps. 88:1-18; Ps. 77:1-12; Song of Sol. 5:2-3, 6; Ps. 51:8, 12; Ps. 31:22; Ps. 22:1; 1 John 3:9; Job 13:15; Ps. 73:15, 23; Isa. 54:7-10.Q. 82. What is the communion in glory which the members of the invisible Church have with Christ?A. The communion in glory which the members of the invisible Church have with Christ, is in this life, immediately after death, and at last perfected at the resurrection and day of judgment.2 Cor. 3:18; Luke 23:43; 1 Thess. 4:17.Q. 83. What is the communion in glory with Christ which the members of the invisible Church enjoy in this life?A. The members of the invisible Church have communicated to them in this life the first-fruits of glory with Christ, as they are members of him their head, and so in him are interested in that glory which he is fully possessed of; and, as an earnest thereof, enjoy the sense of God’s love, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and hope of glory; as, on the contrary, sense of God’s revenging wrath, horror of conscience, and a fearful expectation of judgment, are to the wicked the beginning of their torments which they shall endure after death.Eph.2:6; Rom. 5:5 with 2 Cor. 1:22; Rom. 5:1-2; Rom. 14:17; Gen. 4:13; Matt. 27:4; Heb. 10:27; Rom. 2:9; Mark 9:44.Q. 84. Shall all men die?A. Death being threatened as the wages of sin, it is appointed unto all men once to die; for that all have sinned.Rom. 6:23; Heb. 9:27; Rom. 5:12.Q. 85. Death, being the wages of sin, why are not the righteous delivered from death, seeing all their sins are forgiven in Christ?A. The righteous shall be delivered from death itself at the last day, and even in death are delivered from the sting and curse of it; so that, although they die, yet it is out of God’s love, to free them perfectly from sin and misery, and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which they then enter upon.1 Cor. 15:26, 55-57; Heb. 2:15; Isa. 57:1-2; 2 Kings 22:20; Rev. 14:13; Eph. 5:27; Luke 23:43; Phil. 1:23.Q. 86. What is the communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible Church enjoy immediately after death?A. The communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible Church enjoy immediately after death, is, in that their souls are then made perfect in holiness, and received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory; waiting for the full redemption of their bodies, which even in death continue united to Christ, and rest in their graves, as in their beds, till at the last day they be again united with their souls. Whereas the souls of the wicked are at their death cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness; and their bodies kept in their graves, as in their prisons, until the resurrection and judgment of the great day.Heb. 12:23; 2 Cor. 5:1, 6, 8; Phil. 1:23; Acts 3:21; Eph. 4:10; 1 John 3:2; 1 Cor. 13:12; Rom. 8:23; Ps. 16:9; 1 Thess. 4:14; Isa. 57:2; Job 19:26-27; Luke 16:23-24; Acts 1:25; Jude 1:6-7.Q. 87. What are we to believe concerning the resurrection?A. We are to believe, that, at the last day, there shall be a general resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust: when they that are then found alive shall in a moment be changed; and the selfsame bodies of the dead which are laid in the grave, being then again united to their souls for ever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ. The bodies of the just, by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his resurrection as their head, shall be raised in power, spiritual, incorruptible, and made like to his glorious body; and the bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in dishonor by him, as an offended judge.Acts 24:15; 1 Cor. 15:51-53; 1 Thess. 4:15-17; John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:21-23, 42-44; Phil. 3:21; John 5:27-29; Matt. 25:33.Q. 88. What shall immediately follow after the resurrection?A. Immediately after the resurrection shall follow the general and final judgment of angels and men; the day and hour whereof no man knoweth, that all may watch and pray, and be ever ready for the coming of the Lord.2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 1:6-7, 14-15; Matt. 25:46; Matt. 24:36, 42, 44; Luke 21:35-36.Q. 89. What shall be done to the wicked at the day of judgment?A. At the day of judgment, the wicked shall be set on Christ’s left hand, and, upon clear evidence and full conviction of their own consciences, shall have the fearful but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against them; and thereupon shall be cast out from the favorable presence of God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ, his saints, and all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments both of body and soul, with the devil and his angels for ever.Matt. 25:33; Rom. 2:15-16; Matt. 25:41-43; Luke 16:26; 2 Thess. 1:8-9.Q. 90. What shall be done to the righteous at the day of judgment?A. At the day of judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in the clouds, shall be set on his right hand, and there openly acknowledged and acquitted, shall join with him in the judging of reprobate angels and men, and shall be received into heaven, where they shall be fully and for ever freed from all sin and misery; filled with inconceivable joys, made perfectly holy and happy both in body and soul, in the company of innumerable saints and holy angels, but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, to all eternity. And this is the perfect and full communion, which the members of the invisible Church shall enjoy with Christ in glory, at the resurrection and day of judgment.1 Thess. 4:17; Matt. 25:33; Matt. 10:32; 1 Cor. 6:2-3; Matt. 25:34, 46; Eph. 5:27; Rev. 14:13; Ps. 16:11; Heb. 12:22-23; 1 John 3:2; 1 Cor. 13:12; 1 Thess. 4:17-18.Having Seen What the Scriptures Principally Teach Us To Believe Concerning God, It Follows To Consider What They Require As the Duty of ManQ. 91. What is the duty which God requireth of man?A. The duty which God requireth of man is obedience to his revealed will.Rom. 12:1-2; Mic. 6:8; 1 Sam. 15:22.Q. 92. What did God at first reveal unto man as the rule of his obedience?A. The rule of obedience revealed to Adam in the estate of innocence, and to all mankind in him, beside a special command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was the moral law.Gen. 1:26-27; Rom. 2:14-15; Rom. 10:5; Gen. 2:17.Q. 93. What is the moral law?A. The moral law is the declaration of the will of God to mankind, directing and bonding every one to personal, perfect, and perpetual conformity and obedience thereunto, in the frame and disposition of the whole man, soul and body, and in performance of all those duties of holiness and righteousness which he oweth to God and man: promising life upon the fulfilling, and threatening death upon the breach of it.Deut. 5:1-3, 31, 33; Luke 10:26-27; Gal. 3:10; 1 Thess. 5:23; Luke 1:75; Acts 24:16; Rom. 10:5; Gal. 3:10, 12.Q. 94. Is there any use of the moral law to man since the fall?A. Although no man, since the fall, can attain to righteousness and life by the moral law; yet there is great use thereof, as well common to all men, as peculiar either to the unregenerate, or the regenerate.Rom. 8:3; Gal. 2:16; 1 Tim. 1:8.Q. 95. Of what use is the moral law to all men?A. The moral law is of use to all men, to inform them of the holy nature and will of God, and of their duty, binding them to walk accordingly; to convince them of their disability to keep it, and of the sinful pollution of their nature, hearts, and lives; to humble them in the sense of their sin and misery, and thereby help them to a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and of the perfection of his obedience.Lev. 11:44-45; Lev. 20:7-8; Rom. 7:12; Mic. 6:8; Jas. 2:10-11; Ps. 19:11-12; Rom. 3:20; Rom. 7:7; Rom. 3:9, 23; Gal. 3:21-22; Rom. 10:4.Q. 96. What particular use is there of the moral law to unregenerate men?A. The moral law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their consciences to flee from wrath to come, and to drive them to Christ; or, upon their continuance in the estate and way of sin, to leave them inexcusable, and under the curse thereof.1 Tim. 1:9-10; Gal. 3:24; Rom. 1:20; Rom. 2:15; Gal. 3:10.Q. 97. What special use is there of the moral law to the regenerate?A. Although they that are regenerate, and believe in Christ, be delivered from the moral law as a covenant of works, so as thereby they are neither justified nor condemned: yet, beside the general uses thereof common to them with all men, it is of special use to show them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling it, and enduring the curse thereof in their stead and for their good; and thereby to provoke them to more thankfulness, and to express the same in their greater care to conform themselves thereunto as the rule of their obedience.Rom. 6:14; Rom. 7:4, 6; Gal. 4:4-5; Rom. 3:20; Gal. 5:23; Rom. 8:1; Rom. 7:24-25; Gal. 3:13-14; Rom. 8:3-4; Luke 1:68-69, 74-75; Col. 1:12-14; Rom. 7:22; Rom. 12:2; Titus 2:11-14.Q. 98. Where is the moral law summarily comprehended?A. The moral law is summarily comprehended in the ten commandments, which were delivered by the voice of God upon mount Sinai, and written by him in two tables of stone; and are recorded in the twentieth chapter of Exodus. The four first commandments containing our duty to God, and the other six our duty to man.Deut. 10:4; Ex. 34:1-4; Matt. 22:37-40.Q. 99. What rules are to be observed for the right understanding of the ten commandments?A. For the right understanding of the ten commandments, these rules are to be observed:1. That the law is perfect, and bindeth every one to full conformity in the whole man unto the righteousness thereof, and unto entire obedience for ever; so as to require the utmost perfection of every duty, and to forbid the least degree of every sin.2. That it is spiritual, and so reacheth the understanding, will, affections, and all other powers of the soul; as well as words, works, and gestures.3. That one and the same thing, in divers respects, is required or forbidden in several commandments.4. That as, where a duty is commanded, the contrary sin is forbidden; and, where a sin is forbidden the contrary duty is commanded: so, where a promise is annexed, the contrary threatening is included; and, where a threatening is annexed, the contrary promise is included.5. That what God forbids, is at no time to be done; what he commands, is always our duty; and yet every particular duty is not to be done at all times.6. That under one sin or duty, all of the same kind are forbidden or commanded; together with all the causes, means, occasions, and appearances thereof, and provocations thereunto.7. That what is forbidden or commanded to ourselves, we are bound, according to our places, to endeavor that it may be avoided or performed by others, according to the duty of their places.8. That in what is commanded to others, we are bound, according to our places and callings, to be helpful to them; and to take heed of partaking with others in what is forbidden them.Ps. 19:7; Jas. 2:10; Matt. 5:21-22; Rom. 7:14; Deut. 6:5; Matt. 22:37-39; Matt. 5: 27-28, 33-34, 37-39, 43-44; Col. 3:5; Amos 8:5; Prov. 1:19; 1 Tim. 6:10; Isa. 58:13; Deut. 6:13; Matt. 4:9-10; Matt. 15:4-6; Matt. 5:21-24; Eph. 4:28; Ex. 20:12; Prov. 30:17; Jer. 18:7-8; Ex. 20:7; Ps. 15:1, 4-5; Ps. 24:4-5; Job 13:7-8; Rom. 3:8; Job 36:21; Heb. 11:25; Deut. 4:8-9; Matt. 12:7, Matt. 5:21-22, 27-28; Matt. 15:4-6; Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Thess. 5:22; Jude 1:23; Gal. 5:26; Col. 3:21; Ex. 20:10; Lev. 19:17; Gen. 18:19; Josh. 24:15: Deut. 6:6-7; 2 Cor. 1:24; 1 Tim. 5:22; Eph. 5:11.Q. 100.

What reasons are annexed to the third commandment?A. The reasons annexed to the third commandment, in these words, “The Lord thy God,” and “for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain” are, because he is the Lord and our God, therefore his name is not to be profaned or any way abused by us; especially because he will be so far from acquitting and sparing the transgressors of this commandment, as that he will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgment, albeit many such escape the censures and punishments of men.Ex. 20:7; Lev. 19:12; Ezek. 36:21-23; Deut. 28:58-59; Zech. 5:2-4; 1 Sam. 2:12, 17, 22, 24; 1 Sam. 3:13.Q. 115. What is the fourth commandment?A. The fourth commandment is, Remember the sabbath-day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath-day and hallowed it.Ex. 20:8-11.Q. 116. What is required in the fourth commandment?A. The fourth commandment requireth of all men the sanctifying or keeping holy to God such set times as he hath appointed in his word, expressly one whole day in seven; which was the seventh from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since, and so to continue to the end of the world; which is the Christian sabbath, and in the New Testament called The Lord’s Day.Deut. 5:12-14; Gen. 2:2-3; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; Acts 20:7; Matt. 5:17-18; Isa. 56:2, 4, 6-7; Rev. 1:10.Q. 117. How is the sabbath or the Lord’s day to be sanctified?A. The sabbath or Lord’s day is to be sanctified by an holy resting all the day, not only from such works as are at all times sinful, but even from such worldly employments and recreations as are on other days lawful; and making it our delight to spend the whole time (except so much of it as is to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy) in the public and private exercises of God’s worship: and, to that end, we are to prepare our hearts, and with such foresight, diligence, and moderation, to dispose, and seasonably to despatch our worldly business, that we may be the more free and fit for the duties of that day.Ex. 20:8, 10; Ex. 16:25-28; Neh. 13:15-22; Jer. 17:21-22; Matt. 12:1-13; Isa. 58:13; Luke 4:16; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; Ps. 92 title; Isa. 66:23; Lev. 23:3; Ex. 20:8; Luke 23:54, 56; Ex. 16:22, 25-26, 29; Neh. 13:19.Q. 118. Why is the charge of keeping the sabbath more specially directed to governors of families and other superiors?A. The charge of keeping the sabbath is more specially directed to governors of families and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their charge; and because they are prone ofttimes to hinder them by employments of their own.Ex. 20:10; Josh. 24:15; Neh. 13:15, 17; Jer. 17:20-22; Ex. 23:12.Q. 119. What are the sins forbidden in the fourth commandment?A. The sins forbidden in the fourth commandment are, all omissions of the duties required, all careless, negligent, and unprofitable performing of them, and being weary of them; all profaning the day by idleness, and doing that which is in itself sinful; and by all needless works, words, and thoughts, about our worldly employments and recreations.Ezek 22:26; Acts 20:7, 9; Ezek. 33:30-32; Amos 8:5; Mal. 1:13; Ezek. 23:38; Jer. 17:24, 27; Isa. 58:13.Q. 120. What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it?A. The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words, six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: from God’s challenging a special propriety in that day, the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: from the example of God, who in six days made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it, wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath-day and hallowed it.Ex. 20:9; Ex. 20:10; Ex. 20:11.Q. 121. Why is the word remember set in the beginning of the fourth commandment?A. The word remember is set in the beginning of the fourth commandment, partly, because of the great benefit of remembering it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it; and, in keeping it, better to keep all the rest of the commandments, and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation and redemption, which contain a short abridgement of religion; and partly, because we are very ready to forget it, for that there is less light of nature for it, and yet it restraineth our natural liberty in things at other times lawful; that it cometh but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often take off our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it; and that Satan with his instruments much labor to blot out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.Ex. 20:8; Ex. 16:23; Luke 23:54, 56; Mark 15:42; Neh. 13:19; Ps. 92 title, 13-14; Ezek. 20:12, 19-20; Gen. 2:2-3; Ps. 118:22, 24; Acts 4:10-11; Rev. 1:10; Ezek. 22:26; Neh. 9:14; Ex. 34:21; Deut. 5:14-15; Amos 8:5; Lam. 1:7; Jer. 17:21-23; Neh. 13:15-23.Q. 122. What is the sum of the six commandments which contain our duty to man?A. The sum of the six commandments which contain our duty to man, is, to love our neighbor as ourselves, and to do to others what we would have them to do to us.Matt. 22:39; Matt. 7:12.Q. 123. Which is the fifth commandment?A. The fifth commandment is, Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.Ex. 20:12.Q. 124. Who are meant by father and mother in the fifth commandment?A. By father and mother, in the fifth commandment, are meant, not only natural parents, but all superiors in age and gifts; and especially such as, by God’s ordinance, are over us in place of authority, whether in family, church, or commonwealth.Prov. 23:22, 25: Eph. 6:1-2; 1 Tim. 5:1-2; Gen. 4:20-22; Gen. 45:8; 2 Kings 5:13; 2 Kings 2:12; 2 Kings 13:14; Gal. 4:19; Isa. 49:23.Q. 125. Why are superiors styled father and mother?A. Superiors are styled father and mother, both to teach them in all duties towards their inferiors, like natural parents, to express love and tenderness to them, according to their several relations; and to work inferiors to a greater willingness and cheerfulness in performing their duties to their superiors, as to their parents.Eph. 6:4; 2 Cor. 12:14; 1 Thess. 2:7-8, 11; Num. 11:11-12; 1 Cor. 4:14-16; 2 Kings 5:13.Q. 126.

How is the Word made effectual to salvation?A. The Spirit of God maketh the reading, but especially the preaching of the Word, an effectual means of enlightening, convincing, and humbling sinners; of driving them out of themselves, and drawing them unto Christ; of conforming them to his image, and subduing them to his will; of strengthening them against temptations and corruptions; of building them up in grace, and establishing their hearts in holiness and comfort through faith unto salvation.Neh. 8:8; Acts 26:18; Ps. 19:8; 1 Cor. 14:24-25; 2 Chron. 34:18-19, 26-28; Acts 2:37, 41; Acts 8:27-39; 2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Cor. 10:4-6; Rom. 6:17; Matt. 4:4, 7, 10; Eph. 6:16-17; Ps. 19:11; 1 Cor. 10:11; Acts 20:32; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Rom. 16:25; 1 Thess. 3:2, 10-11, 13; Rom. 15:4; Rom. 10:13-17; Rom. 1:16.Q. 156.

How do the Sacraments become effectual means of salvation?A. The Sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not by any power in themselves, or any virtue derived from the piety or intention of him by whom they are administered; but only by the working of the Holy Ghost, and the blessing of Christ by whom they are instituted.1 Pet. 3:21; Acts 8:13, 23; 1 Cor. 3:6-7; 1 Cor. 12:13.Q. 162. What is a Sacrament?A.

What are the parts of a Sacrament?A.

How many Sacraments hath Christ instituted in his Church under the New Testament?A. Under the New Testament Christ hath instituted in his Church only two Sacraments, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 11:20, 23; Matt. 26:26-28.Q. 165. What is Baptism?A. Baptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, wherein Christ hath ordained the washing with water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, to be a sign and seal of ingrafting into himself, of remission of sins by his blood, and regeneration by his Spirit; of adoption, and resurrection unto everlasting life; and whereby the parties baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible Church, and enter into an open and professed engagement to be wholly and only the Lord’s.Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 11:20, 23; Matt. 26:26-28; Matt. 5:26; Gal. 3:26-27; 1 Cor. 15:29; Rom. 6:5; 1 Cor. 12:13; Rom. 6:4.Q. 166. Unto whom is Baptism to be administered?A. Baptism is not to be administered to any that are out of the visible Church, and so strangers from the covenant of promise, till they profess their faith in Christ, and obedience to him; but infants descended from parents, either both or but one of them professing faith in Christ, and obedience to him, are in that respect, within the covenant, and to be baptized.Acts 8:36-37; Acts 2:38; Gen. 17:7, 9; Gal. 3:9, 14; Col. 2:11-12; Acts 2:38-39; Rom. 4:11-12; 1 Cor. 7:14; Matt. 28:19; Luke 18:15-16; Rom. 11:16.Q. 167. How is our Baptism to be improved by us?A. The needful but much neglected duty of improving our Baptism, is to be performed by us all our life long, especially in the time of temptation, and when we are present at the administration of it to others, by serious and thankful consideration of the nature of it, and of the ends for which Christ instituted it, the privileges and benefits conferred and sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made therein; by being humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling short of, and walking contrary to, the grace of the Baptism and our engagements; by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin, and of all other blessings sealed to us in that Sacrament; by drawing strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we are baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening of grace; and by endeavoring to live by faith, to have our conversation in holiness and righteousness, as those that have therein given up their names to Christ; and to walk in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same Spirit into one body.Col. 2:11-12; Rom. 6:4, 6, 11; Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 1:11-13; Rom. 6:2-3; Rom. 4:11-12; 1 Pet. 3:21; Rom. 6:3-5; Gal. 3:26-27; Rom. 6:22; Acts 2:38; 1 Cor. 12:13, 25-27.Q. 168. What is the Lord’s Supper?A. The Lord’s Supper is a Sacrament of the New Testament, wherein, by giving and receiving bread and wine according to the appointment of Jesus Christ, his death is shewed forth; and they that worthily communicate feed upon his body and blood, to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace; have their union and communion with him confirmed; testify and renew their thankfulness, and engagement to God, and their mutual love and fellowship each with other, as members of the same mystical body.Luke 22:20; Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 11:23-26; 1 Cor. 10:16; 1 Cor. 11:24; 1 Cor. 10:14-16, 21; 1 Cor. 10:17.Q. 169. How hath Christ appointed bread and wine to be given and received in the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper?A. Christ hath appointed the ministers of his Word, in the administration of this Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, to set apart the bread and wine from common use, by the word of institution, thanksgiving, and prayer; to take and break the bread, and to give both the bread and the wine to the communicants: who are, by the same appointment, to take and eat the bread, and to drink the wine, in thankful remembrance that the body of Christ was broken and given, and his blood shed, for them.1 Cor. 11:23-24; Matt. 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20.Q. 170. How do they that worthily communicate in the Lord’s Supper feed upon the body and blood of Christ therein?A. As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present in, with, or under the bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper; and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly and really than the elements themselves are to their outward senses; so they that worthily communicate in the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal or carnal, but in a spiritual manner; yet truly and really, while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death.Acts 3:21; Matt. 26:26, 28; 1 Cor. 11:24-29; 1 Cor. 10:16.Q. 171. How are they that receive the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper to prepare themselves before they come unto it?A. They that receive the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, are, before they come, to prepare themselves thereunto, by examining themselves of their being in Christ; of their sins and wants; of the truth and measure of their knowledge, faith, repentance, love to God and the brethren, charity to all men, forgiving those that have done them wrong; of their desires after Christ, and of their new obedience; and by renewing the exercise of these graces, by serious meditation, and fervent prayer.1 Cor. 11:28; 2 Cor. 13:5; 1 Cor. 5:7; Ex. 12:15; 1 Cor. 11:29; 2 Cor. 13:5; Matt. 26:28; Zech. 12:10; 1 Cor. 11:31; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; Acts 2:46-47; 1 Cor. 5:8; 1 Cor. 11:18, 20; Matt. 5:23-24; Isa. 55:1; John 7:37; 1 Cor. 5:7-8; 1 Cor. 11:25-26, 28; Heb. 10:21-22, 24; Ps. 26:6; 1 Cor. 11:24-25; 2 Chron. 30:18-19; Matt. 26:26.Q. 172. May one who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation, come to the Lord’s Supper?A. One who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, may have true interest in Christ, though he be not yet assured thereof; and in God’s account hath it, if he be duly affected with the apprehension of the want of it, and unfeignedly desires to be found in Christ, and to depart from iniquity: in which case (because promises are made, and this Sacrament is appointed, for the relief even of weak and doubting Christians) he is to bewail his unbelief, and labor to have his doubts resolved; and, so doing, he may and ought to come to the Lord’s Supper, that he may be further strengthened.Isa. 1:10; 1 John 5:13; Ps. 88:1-18; Ps. 77:1-12; Jonah 2:4, 7; Isa. 54:7-10; Matt. 5:3-4; Ps. 31:22; Ps. 73:13, 22-23; Phil. 3:8-9; Ps. 10:17; Ps. 42:1-2, 5, 11; 2 Tim. 2:19; Isa. 1:10; Ps. 66:18-20; Isa. 40:11, 29, 31; Matt. 11:28; Matt. 12:20; Matt. 26:28; Mark 9:24; Acts 2:37; Acts 16:30; Rom. 4:11; 1 Cor. 11:28.Q. 173. May any who profess the faith, and desire to come to the Lord’s Supper, be kept from it?A. Such as are found to be ignorant or scandalous, notwithstanding their profession of the faith, and desire to come to the Lord’s Supper, may and ought to be kept from that Sacrament, by the power which Christ hath left in his Church, until they receive instruction, and manifest their reformation.1 Cor. 11:27-34; Matt. 7:6; 1 Cor. 5:1-13; Jude 1:23; 1 Tim. 5:22; 2 Cor. 2:7.Q. 174.

Wherein do the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper agree?A. The Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper agree, in that the author of both is God; the spiritual part of both is Christ and his benefits; both are seals of the same covenant, are to be dispensed by ministers of the gospel and by none other; and to be continued in the Church of Christ until his second coming.Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 11:23; Rom. 6:3-4; 1 Cor. 10:16; Rom. 4:11; Col. 2:12; Matt. 26:27-28; John 1:33; Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 11:23; 1 Cor. 4:1; Heb. 5:4; Matt. 28:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:26.Q. 177.

Are we to pray unto God only?A. God only being able to search the hearts, hear the requests, pardon the sins, and fulfill the desires of all; and only to be believed in, and worshiped with religious worship; prayer, which is a special part thereof, is to be made by all to him alone, and to none other.1 Kings 8:39; Acts 1:24; Rom. 8:27; Ps. 65:2; Mic. 7:18; Ps. 145:18-19; Rom. 10:14; Matt. 4:10; 1 Cor. 1:2; Ps. 50:15; Rom. 10:14.Q. 180. What is it to pray in the name of Christ?A. To pray in the name of Christ is, in obedience to his command, and in confidence on his promises, to ask mercy for his sake; not by bare mentioning of his name, but by drawing our encouragement to pray, and our boldness, strength, and hope of acceptance in prayer, from Christ and his mediation.John 14:13-14; John 16:24; Dan. 9:17; Matt. 7:21; Heb. 4:14-16; 1 John 5:13-15.Q. 181. Why are we to pray in the name of Christ?A. The sinfulness of man, and his distance from God by reason thereof, being so great, as that we can have no access into his presence without a mediator; and there being none in heaven or earth appointed to, or fit for, that glorious work but Christ alone, we are to pray in no other name but his only.John 14:6; Isa. 59:2; Eph. 3:12; John 6:27; Heb. 7:25-27; 1 Tim. 2:5; Col. 3:17; Heb. 13:15.Q. 182. How doth the Spirit help us to pray?A. We not knowing what to pray for as we ought, the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by enabling us to understand both for whom, and what, and how prayer is to be made; and by working and quickening in our hearts (although not in all persons, nor at all times, in the same measure) those apprehensions, affections, and graces, which are requisite for the right performance of that duty.Rom. 8:26-27; Ps. 10:17; Zech. 12:10.Q. 183. For whom are we to pray?A. We are to pray for the whole church of Christ upon earth; for magistrates and ministers; for ourselves, our brethren, yea, our enemies; and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter; but not for the dead, nor for those that are known to have sinned the sin unto death.Eph.  6:18; Ps.  28:9; 1 Tim.  2:1-2; Col.  4:3; Gen.  32:11; Jas.  5:16; Matt.  5:44; 1 Tim. 2:1-2; John 17:20; 2 Sam. 7:29; 2 Sam. 12:21-23; 1 John 5:16.Q. 184. For what things are we to pray?A. We are to pray for all things tending to the glory of God, the welfare of the church, our own or others’ good; but not for any thing that is unlawful.Matt. 6:9; Ps. 51:18; Ps. 122:6; Matt. 7:11; Ps. 125:4; 1 John 5:14.Q. 185. How are we to pray?A. We are to pray with an awful apprehension of the majesty of God, and deep sense of our unworthiness, necessities, and sins; with penitent, thankful, and enlarged hearts; with understanding, faith, sincerity, fervency, love, and perseverance, waiting upon him, with humble submission to his will.Eccl. 5:1; Gen. 18:27: Gen. 32:10; Luke 15:17-19; Luke 18:13-14; Ps. 51:17; Phil. 4:6; 1 Sam. 1:15; 1 Sam. 2:1; 1 Cor. 14:15; Mark 11:24; Jas. 1:6; Ps. 145:18; Ps. 17:1; Jas. 5:16; 1 Tim. 2:8; Eph. 6:18; Mic. 7:7; Matt. 26:39.Q. 186. What rule hath God given for our direction in the duty of prayer?A. The whole Word of God is of use to direct us in the duty of prayer; but the special rule of direction is that form of prayer which our Saviour Christ taught his disciples, commonly called, The Lord’s Prayer.1 John 5:14; Matt. 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4.Q. 187. How is the Lord’s Prayer to be used?A. The Lord’s Prayer is not only for direction, as a pattern, according to which we are to make other prayers; but may also be used as a prayer, so that it be done with understanding, faith, reverence, and other graces necessary to the right performance of the duty of prayer.Matt. 6:9; Luke 11:2.Q. 188. Of how many parts doth the Lord’s prayer consist?A. The Lord’s prayer consists of three parts; a preface, petitions, and a conclusion.No references.Q. 189. What doth the preface of the Lord’s prayer teach us?A. The preface of the Lord’s prayer (contained in these words, Our Father which art in heaven,) teacheth us, when we pray, to draw near to God with confidence of his fatherly goodness, and our interest therein; with reverence, and all other child-like dispositions, heavenly affections, and due apprehensions of his sovereign power, majesty, and gracious condescension: as also, to pray with and for others.Matt. 6:9; Luke 11:13; Rom. 8:15; Isa. 64:9; Ps. 123:1; Lam. 3:41; Isa. 63:15-16; Neh. 1:4-6; Acts 12:5.Q. 190. What do we pray for in the first petition?A. In the first petition (which is, Hallowed be thy name,) acknowledging the utter inability and indisposition that is in ourselves and all men to honor God aright, we pray, that God would by his grace enable and include us and others to know, to acknowledge, and highly to esteem him, his titles, attributes, ordinances, word, works, and whatsoever he is pleased to make himself known by; and to glorify him in thought, word, and deed: that he would prevent and remove atheism, ignorance, idolatry, profaneness, and whatsoever is dishonorable to him; and by his overruling providence, direct and dispose of all things to his own glory.Matt. 6:9; 2 Cor. 3:5; Ps. 51:15: Ps. 67:2-3; Ps. 83:18; Ps. 86:10-13, 15; 2 Thess. 3:1; Ps. 147:19-20; Ps. 138:1-3; 2 Cor. 2:14-15; Ps. 145:1-21: Ps. 8; Ps. 103:1; Ps. 19:14; Phil. 1:9, 11; Ps. 67:1-4; Eph. 1:17-18; Ps. 97:7; Ps. 74:18, 22-23; 2 Kings 19:15-16; 2 Chron. 20:6, 10-12; Ps. 83:1-18; Ps. 140:4-8.Q. 191. What do we pray for in the second petition?A. In the second petition, (which is, Thy Kingdom come,) acknowledging ourselves and all mankind to be by nature under the dominion of sin and Satan, we pray that the kingdom of sin and Satan may be destroyed, the gospel propagated throughout the world, the Jews called, the fulness of the Gentiles brought in; the church furnished with all gospel officers and ordinances, purged from corruption, countenanced and maintained by the civil magistrates; that the ordinances of Christ may be purely dispensed, and made effectual to the converting of those that are yet in their sins, and the confirming, comforting, and building up those that are already converted: that Christ would rule in our hearts here, and hasten the time of his second coming, and our reigning with him for ever: and that he would be pleased so to exercise the kingdom of his power in all the world, as may best conduce to these ends.Matt. 6:10; Eph. 2:2-3; Ps. 68:1, 18; Rev. 12:10-11; 2 Thess. 3:1; Rom. 10:1; John 17:9, 20; Rom. 11:25-26; Ps. 67:1-7; Matt. 9:38; 2 Thess. 3:1; Mal. 1:11; Zeph. 3:9; 1 Tim. 2:1-2; Acts 4:29-30; Eph. 3:14-20; Rev. 22:20; Isa. 64:1-2; Rev. 4:8-11; Eph. 6:18-20; Rom. 15:29-30, 32; 2 Thess. 1:11; 2 Thess. 2:16-17.Q. 192. What do we pray for in the third petition?A. In the third petition, (which is, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,) acknowledging that by nature we and all men are not only utterly unable and unwilling to know and do the will of God, but prone to rebel against his word, to repine and murmur against his providence, and wholly inclined to do the will of the flesh, and of the devil: we pray, that God would by his Spirit take away from ourselves and others all blindness, weakness, indisposedness, and perverseness of heart; and by his grace make us able and willing to know, do, and submit to his will in all things, with the like humility, cheerfulness, faithfulness, diligence, zeal, sincerity, and constancy, as the angels do in heaven.Matt. 6:10; Rom. 7:18; Job 21:14; 1 Cor. 2:14; Rom. 8:7; Ex. 17:7; Num. 14:2; Eph. 2:2; Eph. 1:17-18; Eph. 3:16; Matt. 26:40-41; Jer. 31:18-19; Ps. 119:1, 8, 35-36; Acts 21:14; Mic. 6:8; Ps. 100:2; Job 1:21; 2 Sam. 15:25-26; Isa. 38:3; Ps. 119:4-5; Rom. 12:11; Ps. 119:80; Ps. 119:112; Isa. 6:2-3; Ps. 103:20-21; Matt. 18:10.Q. 193. What do we pray for in the fourth petition?A. In the fourth petition, (which is, Give us this day our daily bread,) acknowledging, that in Adam, and by our own sin, we have forfeited our right to all the outward blessings of this life, and deserve to be wholly deprived of them by God, and to have them cursed to us in the use of them; and that neither they of themselves are able to sustain us, nor we to merit, or by our own industry to procure them; but prone to desire, get, and use them unlawfully: we pray for ourselves and others, that both they and we, waiting upon the providence of God from day to day in the use of lawful means, may of his free gift, and as to his fatherly wisdom shall seem best, enjoy a competent portion of them, and have the same continued and blessed unto us in our holy and comfortable use of them, and contentment in them; and be kept from all things that are contrary to our temporal support and comfort.Matt. 6:11; Gen. 2:17; Gen. 3:17; Rom. 8:20-22; Jer. 5:25; Deut. 28:15-68; Deut. 8:3; Gen. 32:10; Deut. 8:17-18; Jer. 6:13; Mark 7:21-22; Hos. 12:7; Jas. 4:3; Gen. 43:12-14; Gen. 28:20; Eph. 4:28; 2 Thess. 3:11-12; Phil. 4:6; 1 Tim. 4:3-5; 1 Tim. 6:6-8; Prov. 30:8-9.Q. 194. What do we pray for in the fifth petition?A. In the fifth petition, (which is, Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,) acknowledging, that we and all others are guilty both of original and actual sin, and thereby become debtors to the justice of God; and that neither we, nor any other creature, can make the least satisfaction of that debt: we pray for ourselves and others, that God of his free grace would, through the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, apprehended and applied by faith, acquit us both from the guilt and punishment of sin, accept us in his Beloved, continue his favour and grace to us, pardon our daily failings, and fill us with peace and joy, in giving us daily more and more assurance of forgiveness; which we are the rather emboldened to ask, and encouraged to expect, when we have this testimony in ourselves, that we from the heart forgive others their offences.Matt. 6:12; Rom. 3:9-22; Matt. 18:24-25; Ps. 130:3-4; Rom. 3:24-26; Heb. 9:22; Eph. 1:6-7; 2 Pet. 1:2; Hos. 14:2; Jer. 14:7; Rom. 15:13; Ps. 51:7-10, 12; Luke 11:4; Matt. 6:14-15; Matt. 18:35.Q. 195.

In the sixth petition, (which is, And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,) acknowledging that the most wise, righteous, and gracious God, for divers holy and just ends, may so order things that we may be assaulted, foiled, and for a time led captive by temptations; that Satan, the world, and the flesh, are ready powerfully to draw us aside and ensnare us; and that we, even after the pardon of our sins, by reason of our corruption, weakness, and want of watchfulness, are not only subject to be tempted, and forward to expose ourselves unto temptations; but also of ourselves unable and unwilling to resist them, to recover out of them, and to improve them; and worthy to be left under the power of them: we pray, that God would so overrule the world and all in it, subdue the flesh, and restrain Satan, order all things, bestow and bless all means of grace, and quicken us to watchfulness in the use of them, that we and all his people may by his providence be kept from being tempted to sin; or, if tempted, that by his Spirit we may be powerfully supported and enabled to stand in the hour of temptation; or when fallen, raised again and recovered out of it, and have a sanctified use and improvement thereof: that our sanctification and salvation may be perfected, Satan trodden under our feet, and we fully freed from sin, temptation, and all evil for ever.Matt. 6:13; 2 Chron. 32:31; 1 Chron. 21:1; Luke 21:34; Mark 4:19; Jas. 1:14; Gal. 5:17; Matt. 26:41; Matt. 26:69-72; Gal. 2:11-14; 2 Chron. 18:3; 2 Chron. 19:2; Rom. 7:23-24; 1 Chron. 21:1-4; 2 Chron. 16:7-10; Ps. 81:11-12; John 17:15; Ps. 51:10; Ps. 119:133; 2 Cor. 12:7-8; 1 Cor. 10:12-13; Heb. 13:20-21; Matt. 26:41; Ps. 19:13; Eph. 3:14-17; 1 Thess. 3:13; Jude 1:24; Ps. 51:12; 1 Pet. 5:8-10; 2 Cor. 13:7, 9; Rom. 16:20; Zech. 3:2; Luke 12:31-32; John 17:15; 1 Thess. 5:23.Q. 196. What doth the conclusion of the Lord’s Prayer teach us?A. The conclusion of the Lord’s Prayer, (which is, For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.) teacheth us to enforce our petitions with arguments, which are to be taken, not from any worthiness in ourselves, or in any other creature, but from God: and with our prayers to join praises, ascribing to God alone eternal sovereignty, omnipotency, and glorious excellency; in regard whereof, as he is able and willing to help us, so we by faith are emboldened to plead with him that he would, and quietly to rely upon him, that he will fulfill our requests. And, to testify this our desire and assurance, we say, Amen.Matt. 6:13; Rom. 15:30; Dan. 9:4, 7-9, 16-19; Phil. 4:6; 1 Chron. 29:10-13; Eph. 3:20-21; Luke 11:13; 2 Chron. 20:6, 11; 2 Chron. 14:11; 1 Cor. 14:16; Rev. 22:20- 21.
